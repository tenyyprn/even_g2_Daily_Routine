# EvenHub Simulator

A development tool for rapid iteration and early-stage debugging of EvenHub
applications. This simulator lets developers preview UI layouts and logic
before running on physical hardware.

This simulator is a supplement to, not a replacement for, hardware testing,
because inconsistencies between the simulator and real glasses can occur.
Always validate on actual hardware before deployment. If you find discrepancies
that affect coding logic, please file a bug report (in Discord for now) so we
can reduce the differences.

## Caveats

### Display & UI Rendering

Due to implementation differences, overall display characteristics (such as
font rendering) may not perfectly match the hardware. The current fidelity
should still be sufficient for layout validation and logic testing.

### List Behavior

List scrolling behavior, especially focused-item positioning on screen, can
vary. This happens because the simulator re-implements drawing logic instead of
sharing embedded source code directly.

### Error Handling

Under normal conditions, the simulator behaves similarly to the hardware.
Error-response handling (for example, invalid inputs) may still differ, but
should converge as the codebase matures.

### Image Processing

The simulator processes images faster and currently does not enforce
constraints such as hardware image-size limits. Future versions may introduce
stricter checks to better simulate hardware behavior.

### Events

- **Status Events:** Not emitted; user profiles and device statuses are hardcoded.
- **Supported Inputs:** Up, Down, Click, Double Click.


## Audio

The simulator now emits `audioEvents`. The data specification for each event is:

- Sample rate: 16000
- Signed 16-bit little-endian PCM
- 100 ms of data per event (3200 bytes, 1600 samples)

## Screenshot

Starting with v0.5.0, the simulator supports exporting the glasses display as
an RGBA PNG file. This is intended for uploading apps to the Evenhub web portal
in the future (maybe), though it can be used for any other suitable scenario.

Upon clicking, the simulator will export the current screen to your Current
Working Directory (CWD) with a filename based on the current time. The full
file path is printed to:

- Simulator stdout (as a warn log)
- Glasses web inspector console

Note: The image is not affected by the 'glow' flags, as that is a visual
post-processing effect only.


## Automation

Starting with v0.7.0, the simulator can expose an HTTP API for programmatic
control, which is intended to make it easier for scripts (and AI agents) to
drive the simulator — send input, capture screenshots, and read console
output.

Launch with `--automation-port` to enable it:

```bash
evenhub-simulator https://my-app.example.com --automation-port 9898
```

Base URL: `http://127.0.0.1:<PORT>`

| Method   | Endpoint                   | Description                                                          |
|----------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `GET`    | `/api/ping`                | Health check, returns `pong`.                                        |
| `GET`    | `/api/screenshot/glasses`  | Current glasses framebuffer as an RGBA PNG (576×288).                |
| `GET`    | `/api/screenshot/webview`  | Screenshot of the main webview as PNG (Linux uses WebKitGTK snapshot; macOS uses WKWebView snapshot; Windows uses WebView2 CapturePreview). |
| `GET`    | `/api/console`             | Captured webview `console.*` output, uncaught errors, failed fetches. Supports `?since_id=<N>` for incremental polling. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/console`             | Clears the console buffer.                                           |
| `POST`   | `/api/input`               | Send a glasses touchpad action. JSON body: `{ "action": "up" \| "down" \| "click" \| "double_click" }`. |

Notes:

- Input is only effective when the app has an active event container (list or
  text). If nothing is listening, the action is silently ignored.
- Console entries are tagged with a monotonically increasing `id`; use
  `since_id` when polling to avoid re-reading old entries.
- Non-console sources are prefixed in the message: `[uncaught] …`,
  `[unhandledrejection] …`, `[fetch] …`.


# Changelog

## v0.7.3 (2026-04-18)

- Fix `/api/screenshot/webview` returning blank images in some cases, now using native webview capture paths on each desktop platform
- Fix: constraint list item text size to be maximum 63 bytes and 20 items

## v0.7.2 (2026-04-15)

- Improved emoji rendering support (including previously missing emoji characters).
- Improved bounce/spring animation stability.
- Better compatibility with newer local build toolchains.

## v0.7.1 (2026-04-09)

A few fixes to behave more like firmware:

- make it no scrollbar even if containers exceed maximum full screen
- cap width/height for single container
- add text container bytes limit to 999

## v0.7.0

- New `--automation-port <PORT>` flag that starts an HTTP server exposing
  endpoints for screenshots, console logs, and glasses input — useful for
  scripted testing and AI-driven automation. See the
  [Automation](#automation) section.
- Default `border_color` is now `0` (invisible) instead of `15` (white), to
  match the glasses.
- Unknown-glyph handling now matches the firmware: `LV_USE_FONT_PLACEHOLDER`
  is enabled, and the underlying lvgl crate is built with the `g2` feature
  that customizes how missing glyphs are rendered to align with the glasses.
- Internal rendering pipeline optimization: the glasses canvas is now streamed
  as raw PNG bytes over a Tauri channel instead of base64-encoded events
  (not important to users though).

## v0.6.2 (2026-03-25)

- adjust container limits (trying to be in sync with firmware behavior)

## v0.6.1 (2026-03-25)

With the updates of evenhub sdk (0.0.8), simulator has a few changes accordingly:

- fixes the previous `borderRadius` typo. Also now it is an error in simulator to have unknown property
fields.
- `Sys_ItemEvent` has added some new fields.
    - For `eventSource` simulator now hardcodes the value 1 (`TOUCH_EVENT_FROM_GLASSES_R`).
    - `imuData` will always be null/None.
    - `systemExitReasonCode` is also ignored here for now.

## v0.5.3 (2026-03-03)

- Now will log original json to stdout if parsing payload error (needs
  `RUST_LOG=debug`)
- change `x_position`/`y_position` type to `i32` (previously was `u32`)

## v0.5.2 (2026-02-28)

- Improve overall rendering accuracy: now with only 4bit colors
- Remove the brightness filter on glasses canvas

## v0.5.1 (2026-02-27)

- Rendering mechanism adjustments
- Improve image rendering

## v0.5.0 (2026-02-26)

- Add screenshot functionality

## v0.4.1 (2026-02-20)

- Performance optimization
- New flag to print default config file location
- Fix completion command

## v0.3.2 (2026-02-18)

- Fix description of config file location

## v0.3.1 (2026-02-17)

- Adjust audio input device listing format

## v0.3.0

- Shell completion support

## v0.2.2

- Adjust audio resampling logic and ability to choose audio input device.
- Add config file support so you do not need to repeat common options.
- Add more command-line flags to override config options.


## v0.2.0 (2026-02-16)

- Upgrade `lvgl-sys` to v9 (via a custom crate), with no obvious visual changes.
- Use a lighter font for CJK characters.
- Add preliminary audio event support.
